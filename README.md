# cryptocurrencyeda

This is a Python package to analyze historical cryptocurrency prices and performance through simple exploratory data analysis including calculations and plotting. Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance. There are four functions that are included in this python package which are described in more detail below. Cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts can use this package to analyze cryptocurrencies of interest.


There are existing Python libraries to access information of cryptocurrency such as [cryptocompare](https://github.com/lagerfeuer/cryptocompare) and [cryptofeed](https://github.com/bmoscon/cryptofeed). There are also existing Python libraries to visualize financial data such as [mplfinance](https://github.com/matplotlib/mplfinance).
Therefore, here we want to build a simple and integrated Python library for accessing, analyzing, and visualizing cryptocurrency.
